Welcome to the EduBlocks Github Repository!
===========================================

About EduBlocks
---------------
EduBlocks is a visual block based programming tool that will hopefully help teachers to introduce text based programming languages, like Python, to children at an earlier age.

EduBlocks features:
* Block Format:
Easy and simple interface that uses a building block format to code.
* Extensive Documentation:
Lots of documentation to get you ready to go quickly. New projects added every 2 weeks.
* Range of libraries:
EduBlocks has a range of libraies like GPIOzero, Minecraft & Sonic Pi. 
* Python View:
Once you have coded the blocks, you can easily switch to the Python View to see the real Python code.

Manual Install
--------------

If you would rather mannually install EduBlocks instead of running our Curl command. Here is the commands to do it:
```
wget http://edublocks.org/downloads/edublocks-armv6l.tar.xz

tar -xf edublocks-armv6l.tar.xz

edublocks/install-deps.sh

edublocks/install.sh
```

Developer Instructions
----------------------

NOTE: Windows users will need to enable symbolic link support before they attempt to clone the repository!



### Dependencies

Install Node.JS 6.10.3 using the appropriate installer for your platform. For Linux and Mac OS X (and also Bash on Windows), we recommend using NVM for this.

Install Yarn:

    npm --global install yarn

Install PIP packages:

    pip3 install edupy python-sonic blinkt explorerhat 'ipython==6.0.0'

#### Full Developer Instuctions

    sudo apt install git build-essential
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
    . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    nvm install 6.10.3
    nvm use 6.10.3
    npm --global install yarn
    
    git clone https://github.com/AllAboutCode/EduBlocks

    cd EduBlocks

    cd ui
    ln -s ../../server/src/protocol.ts src/protocol.ts

    yarn
    yarn run build

    cd ../server
    yarn
    yarn run watch

### Running Server and Client locally in developer mode on your PC

Developer mode allows you to run EduBlocks on your PC and watch for live code changes for developer convenience.

Open two terminal windows/tabs.

In the first terminal, run the UI watcher:

    cd ui
    yarn
    yarn run watch

In the second terminal, run the server:

    cd server
    yarn
    yarn run watch

EduBlocks UI will now be available at http://localhost:8081/



### Releasing a new version

Increment version, this will automatically tag the current commit as the new version:

    yarn version

Push changes along with the new tag to GitHub, triggering a new build:

    git push --tags
    git push

Once build has completed successfully, a new build will be available at:

    http://edublocks.org/downloads/edublocks-armv6l.tar.xz

### Building EduBlocks

Building is performed by our CI platform. See `circle.yml` for more info. The tarball is built using a shell script. This will create the subdirectory `edublocks`. The build script is only intended to be run by the CI platform however it will probably work on most Linux platforms.

To run build script:

    ./tarball-create.sh
